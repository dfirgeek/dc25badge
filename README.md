# DEFCON 25 Hacker Women Badge &amp; Breakfast
##### *Join Hacker Women at Caesar's Palace at 0500HRS to make the annual DEFCON badge run.  At 0800HRS, we'll meet at Cafe Americano for breakfast.*

Say you're going to DEFCON 25, and you'd like to team with other cool hacker women to play the CTFs and do hacker con stuff. So get to sleep early on Wednesday, and awake before the sun for the DC25 Hacker Women Badge & Breakfast Meetup!

## About

Hacker Women run DEFCON badge registration like a pirate operation: Boots to ground at 5am; we join the hordes of zombies by 5:30am. Some of us drink coffee, others vodka. Whatever your taste, by 7am we're fully badged inside DEFCO, and we have a great time! After reg, over breakfast, we'll meet and greet with the awesome women of DEFCON. We make new friends, figure out our conference plans together.  Most critical, this is an opportunity to join with Hacker Women teams for a contest you're coveting, and get in line for contest registrations which begin early in the day when many attendees are still linging up for badges!  Last year the Hacker Women team competed in SECTF and Packet Hacking Village, in DC23 we focused our energies on lockpicking and DC Parties ~ what we do this year is completely up to you!

This meetup is open to the women of DEFCON, their families, and their guests.

## The Meeting Point

2. Found him? Ok. Look to where he's pointing. Step back 5-10 paces, look up. See that sign with the arrow pointing you to Hotel Registration? Yes, that arrow, to the left. Now follow it. Hurry. And take this kitten.

Happy DEFCON 25! Please try to get some sleep after breakfast - 3 hours of sleep per 24 hours is the DEFCON rule :-)
