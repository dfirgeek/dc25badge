# DEFCON 25 Hacker Women Badge &amp; Breakfast
##### *Join Hacker Women at Caesar's Palace at 0500HRS to make the annual DEFCON badge run.  At 0800HRS, we'll meet at Cafe Americano for breakfast.*

Say you're going to DEFCON 25, and you'd like to team with other cool hacker women to play the CTFs and do hacker con stuff. So come to the DC25 Hacker Women Badge & Breakfast Meetup!

## About

Hacker Women run DEFCON badge registration like a pirate operation: Boots to ground at 5am; we join the hordes of zombies by 5:30am. By 7am we're fully badged inside DEFCON! Afterwards, over breakfast, we'll meet and greet with the awesome women of DEFCON. We make new friends, figure out our conference plans together, and sort out radio communications and meeting points.  Most critical, we'll form teams, and get those teams in line for contest registrations which begin in the early afternoon when many attendees are still lined up for their badges!

## The Meeting Point
**Arrive to the meeting point at 0430HRS; Depart for Registration at 0500HRS *sharp*.
